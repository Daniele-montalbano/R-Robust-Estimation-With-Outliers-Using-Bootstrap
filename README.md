# R-Robust-Estimation-With-Outliers-Using-Bootstrap
In this repository, using the statistical software R, are been analyzed robust techniques to estimate multivariate linear regression in presence of outliers, using the Bootstrap, a simulation method where the construction of sample distribution of given statistics occurring through resampling the same observed sample.
